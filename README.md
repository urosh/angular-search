angular-search
==============

Angular search is an application of exploring Starc data collection using angluar.js. 

The application should allow users to select which tools to use when exploring data.. It should also allow communication between different modules. 

The idea is to create a dashboard using angular, which will serve as interactive workspace for data exploration. Advanced search, data visualization, maps, annotations, relationship explorer are just some of the tools that will be available. 

Another goal of this tool is to practice my angular skills. Since i just started using angular, it is good chance to improve my skills and to see how much i learned and where i need to improve my skills and work more.

After some level of maturity is reached, the tools developed here will be used as a basis of the new version of the Starc Repository which will be completely based on Javascript(Angular on fron end, Node on backend).
