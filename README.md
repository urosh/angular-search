angular-search
==============

Angular search is an application of exploring Starc collection using angluar.js. 

The application should allow users to select which tools to use when exploring data collections. It should also allow communication between different modules. 

The idea is to create a dashboard using angular, which will serve as interactive workspace for data exploration. Advnaced search, data visualization, maps, annotations, relationship explorer are just some of the tools that will be available. 

Another goal of this tool is to practive my angular skills. Since i just started using angular, it is good chance to improve my skills and to see how much i learned and where i need to improve my skills and work more.
